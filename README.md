# Job Placement Web Application
The Tech Academy added a new section of their webpage designed to help students keep track of their job applications to potential employers.
This is a code-first MVC application where the database is assembled from students entering information about their applications and job searches.
In addition, the Tech Academy plans to store hiring data (starting salary, days until hired, job field, etc) and make it available to prospective students.
I contributed a number of smaller stories to the larger project and was mainly focused on creating a new web page where Tech Academy students
could network with each other. This included creating a new view, ensuring they were connecting with and displaying data from the database, 
and passing the appropriate information to the table from the controller.

In addition to the networking feature for students, the Job Placement Web Application will be used by the
Job Placement Director, but in order to make it an efficient tool, a page was added specifically for the director where he/she can easily sort
students according to their location and the number of applications they have submitted.

This repository contains screenshots and the actual individual files that I contributed to. It does not contain the entire web application. 

It demonstrates my flexiblity of entering a project I had no previous experience with but being able to contribute working code. 
It also demonstrates my understanding of a basic MVC web application, a code-first approach, database migration, methods, and passing views in
the controller with the appropriate data. Lastly, it demonstrates my ability to adapt and learn quickly in a team-based environment where
communication with fellow students and the project manager was critical to the success of my code and its integration into the larger application.
